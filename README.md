# alexandre-sdd.github.io

Single-page portfolio site built for GitHub Pages.

## How to edit content
Update `docs/content.json`. The site pulls from this file at runtime, so changes publish without rebuilding.

Optional: If you want the no-JavaScript fallback text to match, update the `<noscript>` block in `docs/index.html`.

## How to deploy on GitHub Pages
1. Go to the repository Settings.
2. Open Pages.
3. Under Build and deployment, set Source to "Deploy from a branch".
4. Select `main` branch and `/docs` folder.
5. Save. GitHub Pages will publish the site.

## Local preview
Open `docs/index.html` in a browser or use a simple static file server.
